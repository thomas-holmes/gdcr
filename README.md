Conway's Game of Life
---------------------
[Conway's Game of Life](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_Game_of_Life) is a universe simulation with a very simple rule set. The universe is an infinite orthogonal grid made up of square cells which are either dead or alive. Each cell affects and is affected by its eight neighbors. The whole universe advances simultaneously in steps. At each step the following are the rules that are applied:

1.  Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies (under-population)
2.  Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives to the next generation
3.  Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies (over-crowding)
4.  Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell (reproduction)
